          While I don&apos;t have formal, commercial experience in front-end
          development yet, I bring a decade of diverse professional experience
          across multiple fields. From excelling in task-oriented roles, earning
          recognition as a top-performing chef, and taking on responsibilities
          as a regional sales manager, I&apos;ve honed essential skills like
          problem-solving, adaptability, and perseverance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, at 27, I&apos;m shifting my focus to follow my passion for front-end
          development. I&apos;m not just seeking a jobâ€”I&apos;m seeking a learning
          opportunity. I&apos;m driven to grow, to contribute, and to build a strong
          foundation in the tech industry, prioritizing personal and
          professional development over immediate financial rewards.
